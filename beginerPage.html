    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Cross-Country</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;XC bikes are the fastest climbers and best for long distance racing on smooth
                to moderately technical terrain due to their low weight and focus on efficiency.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Trail</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trail bikes are the versatile all-rounders, blending efficient climbing with
                enough suspension and slackness to confidently handle a wide variety of singletrack trails.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Enduro</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Enduro bikes excel at descending steep and rough terrain quickly, offering
                superior stability and plush suspension, while still being pedalable to the top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Downhill</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DH bikes are designed purely for maximum speed and impact absorption on the
                gnarliest, steepest descents, and are typically not meant to be pedaled uphill.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Gravel</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gravel bikes combine road bike speed with off-road stability, making them
                perfect for long-distance adventure riding, bikepacking, and mixed-surface exploration.</p>
        </li>
        <h2>Recomendations</h2>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beginner mountain bikers should start on green-rated trails which feature smooth,
            wide paths, minimal technical obstacles (like roots or rocks that can't be rolled over), and gentle grades
            to safely build fundamental skills. Focus on ride times of 30 to 60 minutes, or an approximate distance of 5
            to 10 miles (8 to 16 km) on easier terrain, before attempting longer or harder routes. The best conditions
            are dry, clear weather to ensure good traction and prevent trail damage from riding in the mud.</p>
